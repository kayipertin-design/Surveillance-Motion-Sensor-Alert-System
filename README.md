# Surveillance & Motion Sensor Alert System
*Applied Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Project*

## 🎯 Aim
To design and simulate an IoT-based surveillance system using Cisco Packet Tracer that detects motion and immediately alerts the user by activating a smart alarm and surveillance camera.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Traditional surveillance systems require continuous manual monitoring and lack instant response capabilities.  
This project implements an IoT-based motion detection system where a motion detector triggers alerts and camera activation, thereby reducing human dependency and improving response speed.

---

## 🚀 Scope of the Solution
- Applicable for *homes, offices, warehouses, and industrial areas*.  
- Real-time *motion detection + alert notification*.  
- Camera activation for better surveillance.  
- Provides *low-cost simulation* before real-world deployment.  
- Can be extended with IoT servers, cloud integration, and mobile app notifications.

## 🛠 Required Components

### *Software*
- Cisco Packet Tracer (IoT Workspace)  
- Screen Recorder   
- GitHub (for project submission)  
### *Simulated IoT Hardware (in Packet Tracer)*
- Motion Detector  
- IoT Camera  
- Smart Lamp 
- Home Gateway (or Router + Switch)  
- Tablet (for monitoring/logs)

## ⚡ Simulated Circuit
The basic topology connects Motion Detector, Camera, and Smart Lamp to the Home Gateway.  
When motion is detected → Smart Lamp turns ON and Camera activates.

*(Open demo.mp4 in this repository to view the working simulation.)*

---

## 🧪 Working Steps
1. Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Ensure all devices are connected to the Home Gateway.  
3. Motion Detector Rules:  
   - *On Motion Detected → Lamp ON + Camera ON*  
   - *On No Motion → Lamp OFF + Camera OFF*  
4. Run simulation or realtime mode to test.
